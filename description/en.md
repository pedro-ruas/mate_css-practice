# Highest-Paid Athletes

Implement the **Most paid athletes** page according to [the design](https://www.figma.com/file/0Fp7jz0rNDDhlxTdXFyh7o/Athletes?node-id=0%3A1)

- All styles and indents should be the same as on the mockup (pixel perfect).
- You don't need to download images, because HTML uses links to external images, not local files.
- Of course you may change the HTML.
- CSS classes and styles must follow BEM methodology
- Starting from the width of `500px` the page should look exactly as on the design
  (Make sure there is no horizontal scroll)
- Don't improvise anything that is not present on the design (if there is no 5
  columns layout than your page should not have it).
- Hover effect contains 2 parts:
  - the changes shown on the left part of the desigle are applied immediately
  - the changes shown on the right part are applied smoothly during 1s

**Hint:** If it is too hard for you to implement the appearance of profession
description only on hover, so other elements don't move - start by showing it right away.
When it's done - try to show it only on hover, so the starting indents don't change.
